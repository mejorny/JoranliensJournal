                It was freshman year of college. Two 19-year olds from Wisconsin
                were just trying to figure out what their life was going to be
                like down in Florida. And, well, the rest is history.

                People always ask if we knew each other coming into college.
                When we both say that we're from Wisconsin, that is always the
                first question that they ask. But, of course, the answer is,
                "No, we actually met in Florida," to which they normally replay
                something along the lines of "Wow, what a small world!"
                Mackenzie's friend, Jacob, knew Thomas before coming to UCF.
                Jacob had told Mackenzie that there was someone named Thomas who
                lived on the same floor of her dorm, and that she should try to
                find him and introduce herself. So, being eager to meet new
                people, that is exactly what she did. For multiple days, she
                would peak her head outside of her dorm into the hallway and
                call out Thomas's name. Sadly, there was no reply. Until one
                day, a couple weeks into school, this guy named Loki stopped
                over to give Mackenzie's roommate Nicole some corn (that's a
                story for another time).
                <img
                  src="pictures/boop.jpeg"
                  class="left"
                  style="height: 30vh; float: right; margin-left: 20px"
                />Mackenzie called after Loki and asked if one of his roommates'
                names was Thomas. He replyed that he did have a roommate named
                Thomas, so Mackenzie ran across the hall to the room Loki had
                come from. There, she found the one named, Thomas. She quickly
                introduced herself. She asked if he went to Brookfield Central
                for high school, if he programmed, if he knew someone named
                Jacob Franz. When all of the answers were "yes," Mackenzie knew
                she had found the right Thomas. And so, the adventure began.
                There was plenty of spikeball played and plenty of memories made
                that first semester of freshman year. We had a good group of
                friends: four girls and four guys. It really felt like a real
                life version of "Friends." We would stay up until 3 or 4 in the
                morning playing games like Avalon or Cards Against Humanity.
                With college being almost 100% online (perks of freshman year of
                college in 2020), the only thing the eight of us really did that
                first semester was hang out with each other. Not every college
                student can say they had this same experience. We were all
                friends, really good friends, by the end of that first semester
                freshman year of college.

                At least, we think we started dating in March...Second semester
                of freshman year of college felt pretty much the same as the
                first semester. There was more spikeball, more game nights, and
                a lot more memories made. Then, everything happened on the night
                of March 31st (at least, we think that's the right date, neither
                of us really know for sure). Thomas will say that Mackenzie made
                the first move, and Mackenzie will say that Thomas made the
                first move. However, the only thing that really matters is that
                someone did in fact make a move. That night, we found out we
                liked each other. We weren't really sure how a relationship
                would work. There seemed to be a lot of things that were getting
                in our way. But, we decided that we were going to make it work.
                A group of us spent Spring Break 2021 in St. Augustine. That's
                really were we discovered that there was a lot more to our
                relationship than we thought. We would stay up all night talking
                about our lives, our struggles, our joys and our pains. This didn't feel like a relationship that either of us had experienced before.
